# The Effect of Judicial Decisions on Policy Narratives
Analyzing the Impact of Roe v. Wade's Overturning on Digital Discourse Using Machine Learning 

## Abstract
Understanding how judicial decisions influence political narrative strategies is critical for grasping the interplay between legal rulings, public opinion, and policymaking, particularly in areas as contentious as abortion rights.
This study examines how the overturning of Roe v. Wade affected the narrative strategies of U.S. representatives on social media, with a focus on variations by party affiliation and geographic context due to state-level trigger laws. Employing supervised machine learning for text classification and generalized linear mixed models, this research analyzed a dataset of abortion-related tweets from U.S. representatives throughout 2022, identifying shifts in narrative strategies around key events related to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The study found a significant shift toward narratives of decline across both major political parties following the overturning, with variations evident around critical events and influenced by state-level trigger laws.
These findings contribute to narrative policy analysis and political communication, highlighting the strategic use of narratives in response to judicial decisions, the complex interplay between political narratives and electoral strategies, and the nuanced role of geographic and legislative contexts in shaping public discourse.
